Phase 0:
Entities: user, course, course material, forum message.

User types:
	Admin: The admin can post new material (like pdfs) and create new posts on the forum. This type of user can access every part of the web.
	Anonymous user: This user is not registered. The only parts visible are the start page and the information about the different courses as well as having the option to register.
	Registered user: They can comment on the admin posts and visualize the course material.

Images: for images, we have the different official logotypes and the promotional images given by the client.

Charts: we implemented a counter of the registered users and different courses and this can also be visualized in a graphic chart.

Complementary technology: We are consuming the Google Maps API to include a location map. The users also can register and login into the page.

Algorithm: we have a rating system for clients and also a live counter for registered users.
